\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Release) }{Oct 2021 -- Present}{Integration Engineer}{Remote}

\item[]  Having previously been the first customer of Release, I was intimately involved in shaping
the initial feature set.  Eventually, I joined to help found the integration, customer success, and onboarding functions.  Being a tiny startup, this involved everything from
being involved in sales calls, demos, hiring other members of the team, all the way through to
directly contributing features and fixes to the product itself.

The product involved Kubernetes clusters built in customer accounts, and our team was also
responsible for all aspects of those clusters, including observability, upgrades, and all other aspects of
running dozens of Kubernetes clusters in production.

\begin{rSubsection}{Beeswax (acquired by Comcast) }{August 2020 -- x}{Director of SRE}{Remote}

\item[]  At Beeswax, I inherited the SRE team from the previous manager (the CTO) and overhauled our planning, processes, and priorities to improve our ability to deliver on slipping commitments.

During my time at Beeswax we modernized our loadbalancer layer (millions of requests a second), migrated to Kubernetes to replace thousands of VMs, replaced our observability stack, overhauled our CI/CD systems, and broadly delivered on commitments to the business.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Simon Data}{April 2019 -- Present}{Head Of Devops}{Remote}

\item[] At Simon, I founded and led the devops team.  We took on the challenge of modernizing the developer tooling experience.  This was a combination of introducing modern observability tools, reworking the CI/CD pipelines, migrating to docker as a runtime, and updating and upgrading systems across the board.  The team has remained small, with just myself and two reports, but we've been able to build a solid foundation for the future.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Everquote}{June 2018 -- April 2019}{VP of Infrastructure}{Cambridge, MA}

\item[] At Everquote, I led the transformation from an outdated "ops team" model to an
  SRE model.  The two teams I lead build self service components for the engineering
  teams and own the "patterns" used throughout the organization to build, deploy, and
  operate the 150+ services that compromise the Everquote platform.  I divide my time
  between coaching the team, managing infrastructure spend across the
  organization, coordinating across engineering teams, and planning for new
  self service capabilities.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Cota Healthcare}{December 2017 -- June 2018}{VP of Infrastructure}{New York, NY}
\item[] I led the Infrastructure and Security teams at Cota, working closely with
  software engineering to help build and scale a ``big data" platform for hospitals,
  insurance, and pharmaceutical companies.  These systems helped analyze huge cancer
  datasets to guide treatments and research.  During my time at Cota I led a overhaul
  in how services were built, deployed, and operated.  This included a cloud migration,
  deployment of Kubernetes, and process changes to software development.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Maxwell Health}{July 2016 -- December 2017}{Director of Infrastructure}{Boston, MA}

\item[] At Maxwell Health, I turned around an operations team in crisis.  After
  hiring to bring the team up to full capacity, we built up the infrastructure
  to turn a six week lead time for servers into an instant self service model
  using Kubernetes.

I split my time between hands on work, such as core infrastructure building,
  mentoring team members, working with engineering teams to transform their
  build and deployment pipelines, as well as taking part in SOC2/HIPAA
  compliance work, product strategy planning, and implementing a Production
  Readiness Review process.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{nToggle}{January 2015 -- July 2016}{Techops Manager}{Boston, MA}

\item[] At nToggle, I rejoined several of my Jumptap coworkers to help launch
  an adtech startup that optimizes and reduces Real Time Bidding traffic for
  our customers.

I designed, and built, our loadbalancer-less (anycast backed) datacenter design
  to deliver our high performance, low latency, platform.  Capable of
  processing millions of QPS in real time, our platform has helped a variety of
  bidders to significantly reduce their traffic, raise their bid rates, and
  improve the delivery of campaigns to drive significant revenue upside.  

I split my time between hands-on engineering work and managing the operations
  team.  This included hiring budgets, cost models and board presentations
  around CAPEX and OPEX spend, as well as vendor relationships and pre-sales
  engineering work with our customers to accurately model their current
  infrastructure costs and demonstrate the significant RoI they can achieve
  through nToggle.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Metacloud}{September 2014 -- January 2015}{Senior Software Engineer}{Pasadena, CA}

\item[] I joined the engineering team at Metacloud to transform the aging QA
  environment.  This was previously managed by hand and I spent several months
  building out Chef automation to rebuild and scale out the testing
  infrastructure.  This eventually led to a migration that reduced testing
  cycles from full days to less than an hour.  Metacloud was acquired by Cisco
  during this time.
