\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Tesorio}{Apr 2024 -- Present}{Head of Devops}{Remote}
\item[] At Tesorio, the Devops team and I have been working to modernize much of the technology behind the scenes. This has included overhauling how we manage Terraform, Kubernetes, CI, and rebuilding our complex deployment system on top of ArgoCD and Kargo.  We've finished a migration off Heroku, drastically improved our reliability and invested significant effort in performance engineering.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Monad}{May 2023 -- Apr 2024}{Head of Infrastructure}{Remote}
\item[] Previously a customer of mine at Release, I joined Monad to help rework the infrastructure, as well as build out on-prem deployments for customers.  With a team of just two engineers, we've completely rebuilt the IaC automation, overhauled observability, revamped the test and deployment pipelines, and rolled out several large projects to add new infrastructure components for engineers (Spark being one of the larger ones).
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Anomalo}{March 2023 -- May 2023}{Senior Software Engineer}{Remote}
\item[] I rejoined my VP of Engineering from Beeswax to help scale out and improve the infrastructure at Anomalo.  Since joining I rolled out observability via Datadog, revamped most of the build system, improved our CI/CD posture, as well as worked closely with developers to improve their development environments.

Shortly after joining my boss was let go, and plans for the future changed.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Release}{October 2021 -- March 2023}{Integration Engineer}{Remote}
\item[]Having previously been the first customer of Release, I was intimately involved in shaping the initial feature set.  Eventually, I joined to help found the integration, customer success, and customer onboarding functions.  Being a tiny startup, this involved everything from being involved in sales calls, demos, hiring other members of the team, all the way through to directly contributing features and fixes to the product itself.

The product involved Kubernetes clusters built in customer accounts, and our team was also responsible for all aspects of those clusters, including observability, upgrades, and all other aspects of running dozens of Kubernetes clusters in production.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Beeswax (Now Comcast)}{August 2020 -- October 2021}{Director of SRE}{Remote}
\item[]At Beeswax, I inherited the SRE team from the previous manager (the CTO) and overhauled planning, processes, and priorities to improve the team's ability to deliver on slipping commitments.

During my tenure we modernized our loadbalancer layer (with a ~10x perf improvement), migrated to Kubernetes for container orchestration, replaced our observability stack, overhauled CI/CD, upgraded and improved the Aerospike clusters.  We achieved all commitments made to the business on time.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Simon Data}{April 2019 -- August 2020}{Head Of Devops}{Remote}
\item[]At Simon, I founded and led the devops team. Focused primarily on modernizing the developer tooling experience, we introduced modern observability tools, reworked the CI/CD pipeline, migrated services to docker, and caught up on years of tech debt.  The team remained small, with just two engineers, but had massive impact on the ability of developers to build and deliver services.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Everquote}{June 2018 -- April 2019}{VP of Infrastructure}{Cambridge, MA}
\item[] At Everquote, I led the transformation from an outdated "ops team" model to an
  SRE model.  The two teams I led built self-service components for the engineering
  teams and own the "patterns" used throughout the organization to build, deploy, and
  operate the 150+ services that comprise the Everquote platform.  I divided my time
  between coaching the team, managing infrastructure spend across the
  organization, coordinating across engineering teams, and planning for new
  self service capabilities.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Cota Healthcare}{December 2017 -- June 2018}{VP of Infrastructure}{New York, NY}
\item[] I led the Infrastructure and Security teams at Cota, working closely with
  software engineering to help build and scale a ``big data" platform for hospitals,
  insurance, and pharmaceutical companies.  These systems helped analyze huge cancer
  datasets to guide treatments and research.  During my time at Cota I led an overhaul
  in how services were built, deployed, and operated.  This included a cloud migration,
  deployment of Kubernetes, and process changes to software development.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Maxwell Health}{July 2016 -- December 2017}{Director of Infrastructure}{Boston, MA}
\item[] At Maxwell Health, I turned around an operations team in crisis.  After
  hiring to bring the team up to full capacity, we built up the infrastructure
  to turn a six-week lead time for servers into an instant self-service model
  using Kubernetes.

I split my time between hands-on work, such as core infrastructure building,
  mentoring team members, working with engineering teams to transform their
  build and deployment pipelines, as well as taking part in SOC2/HIPAA
  compliance work, product strategy planning, and implementing a Production
  Readiness Review process.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{nToggle}{January 2015 -- July 2016}{Techops Manager}{Boston, MA}

\item[] At nToggle, I rejoined several of my Jumptap coworkers to help launch
  an adtech startup that optimizes and reduces Real-Time Bidding traffic for
  our customers.

I designed and built, our loadbalancer-less (anycast backed) datacenter design
  to deliver our high-performance, low-latency platform.  I also split my time between hands-on engineering work and managing the operations
  team.  This included hiring budgets, cost models and board presentations
  around CAPEX and OPEX spend, as well as vendor relationships and pre-sales
  engineering work with our customers to accurately model their current
  infrastructure costs and demonstrate the significant ROI they can achieve
  through nToggle.
