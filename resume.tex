\begin{rSection}{Experience}
\begin{rSubsection}{Everquote}{June 2018 -- Present}{VP of Infrastructure}{Cambridge, MA}

\item[] At Everquote, I led the transformation from an outdated "ops team" model to an
  SRE model.  The two teams I lead build self service components for the engineering
  teams and own the "patterns" used throughout the organization to build, deploy, and
  operate the 150+ services that compromise the Everquote platform.  I divide my time
  between coaching the team, managing infrastructure spend across the
  organization, coordinating across engineering teams, and planning for new
  self service capabilities.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Cota Healthcare}{December 2017 -- June 2018}{VP of Infrastructure}{New York, NY}
\item[] I led the Infrastructure and Security teams at Cota, working closely with
  software engineering to help build and scale a ``big data" platform for hospitals,
  insurance, and pharmaceutical companies.  These systems helped analyze huge cancer
  datasets to guide treatments and research.  During my time at Cota I led a overhaul
  in how services were built, deployed, and operated.  This included a cloud migration,
  deployment of Kubernetes, and process changes to software development.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Maxwell Health}{July 2016 -- December 2017}{Director of Infrastructure}{Boston, MA}

\item[] At Maxwell Health, I turned around an operations team in crisis.  After
  hiring to bring the team up to full capacity, we built up the infrastructure
  to turn a six week lead time for servers into an instant self service model
  using Kubernetes.

I split my time between hands on work, such as core infrastructure building,
  mentoring team members, working with engineering teams to transform their
  build and deployment pipelines, as well as taking part in SOC2/HIPAA
  compliance work, product strategy planning, and implementing a Production
  Readiness Review process.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{nToggle}{January 2015 -- July 2016}{Techops Manager}{Boston, MA}

\item[] At nToggle, I rejoined several of my Jumptap coworkers to help launch
  an adtech startup that optimizes and reduces Real Time Bidding traffic for
  our customers.

I designed, and built, our loadbalancer-less (anycast backed) datacenter design
  to deliver our high performance, low latency, platform.  Capable of
  processing millions of QPS in real time, our platform has helped a variety of
  bidders to significantly reduce their traffic, raise their bid rates, and
  improve the delivery of campaigns to drive significant revenue upside.  

I split my time between hands-on engineering work and managing the operations
  team.  This included hiring budgets, cost models and board presentations
  around CAPEX and OPEX spend, as well as vendor relationships and pre-sales
  engineering work with our customers to accurately model their current
  infrastructure costs and demonstrate the significant RoI they can achieve
  through nToggle.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Metacloud}{September 2014 -- January 2015}{Senior Software Engineer}{Pasadena, CA}

\item[] I joined the engineering team at Metacloud to transform the aging QA
  environment.  This was previously managed by hand and I spent several months
  building out Chef automation to rebuild and scale out the testing
  infrastructure.  This eventually led to a migration that reduced testing
  cycles from full days to less than an hour.  Metacloud was acquired by Cisco
  during this time.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Puppet Labs}{July 2013 -- September 2014}{Senior Software Engineer}{Portland, OR}

\item[] As the first team hire, I was able to initiate and manage key projects
  that allowed Puppetlabs to build a developer community around the previously
  ailing, but critical, set of public modules provided by Puppetlabs.

These projects included our "Supported Modules" initiative, the first
  commercial, vendor backed set of  automation modules.  I redesigned,
  refactored, and rewrote several of these critical modules.  I also designed
  our testing strategy and worked with the team to build thousands of unit and
  acceptance tests across the module base, allowing us to validate them against
  27 supported Puppet Enterprise Platforms.

Other work included refactoring core Puppet code, writing several popular
  guides around building modules, overhauling documentation, and launching
  weekly triage meetings to decrease the backlog of unmerged PRs.  This lead to
  over 2000 PR merges.
